# wildfire_complexing

This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis we completed on four datasets given to us by our partner, Lise Ann st. Denis from the CO-WY Resilience Engine. 

The notebook was imported into GitHub from colab. In colab, the notebook runs properly however in order for it to run properly in github, the file paths may need to be edited so that the data can be properly loaded into the notebooks from the .csv files (these are uploaded in the repository).

Some plots in the notebooks have an issue with lines 9 and 13 in their code, and may need to be run twice (the first of these is in the i_fod notebook). If a particular plot doesn't run properly, try un-commenting lines 9 and 13, running the cell, then commenting out those lines and running it again.
